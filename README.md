3. Supervised learning
Predict if a player has potential to be a Star player or only a role palyer based on the previous draft ranks
(use classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree classification, or random forest classification to classify players into different categories, such as all-star, starter, or bench player, based on their attributes and performance statistics. )
